title: "Making input type=date complicated"
short_desc: "The Input element has lots of quirks, PPK explains."
long_desc: "Everyone who’s ever messed around with dates knows that they are terribly user-hostile — not only for software developers, but also for users. True, users will be able to tell you their date of birth or today’s date without trouble, but ask them to fill them out in a web form and they will encounter problems."
