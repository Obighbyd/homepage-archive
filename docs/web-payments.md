Samsung Internet supports the [Payment Request API](https://www.w3.org/TR/payment-request/), providing
a consistent, easy-to-use check-out experience.

Please note that the Payment Request API simply provides the user interface.
You will still need a suitable [payment gateway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Payment_gateway)
to provide secure payment processing.

## Sample code

There are [example projects here on Github](https://github.com/SamsungInternet/examples).

Here is a simple extracted sample:

```javascript
if (window.PaymentRequest) {

  // Note: The newer 'basic-card' format is supported in Samsung Internet Beta v5.4.
  // This previous format is still supported and will also work in v5.0.
  // Note: These are example payment networks. Others are available. 
  var methodData = [{supportedMethods: ['visa', 'mastercard', 'amex']}];

  var details = {total: {label: 'Something that costs money', amount: {currency: 'GBP', value: '9.99'}}};

  // Show a Payment Request UI and handle the result
  new PaymentRequest(methodData, details)
    .show()
    .then(function(uiResult) {
      processPayment(uiResult);
    })
    .catch(function(error) {
      handlePaymentError(error);
    });

} else {
  // Use a legacy checkout method for browsers without support
}
```
