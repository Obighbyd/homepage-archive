    <h2>Mobile World Progress Amsterdam 2017</h2>
    <p>On 10th of May we’ll have a small evening meet-up in Amsterdam on the topic of progressive web apps. Don’t expect the basics; our two speakers aim to take you well beyond that with some advanced tips and tricks. The entrance fee will be 5 euros, and proceeds will be donated to a charity for teaching children how to program.</p>
