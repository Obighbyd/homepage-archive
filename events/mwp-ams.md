        <h4>The Web Bites Back</h4>
        <p>The rise of mobile apps has had an enormous impact on how people create, consume and share information, how they play games, how they organize their lives. But in the rush to build bigger and better mobile apps, we’ve forgotten one lesson we should have learned from the rise of the Internet in the 1990s: open is better. Meanwhile, the web platform has been undergoing a quiet revolution. New technologies such as web payment, progressive enhancement, off-line use, save-to-homescreen and push notifications are creating a revolution in web applications bringing the best aspects of mobile apps to the web while still keeping the web webby.</p>
