## General Description
Samsung Internet is one of the top mobile web browsers worldwide, with hundreds of millions of users. As one of the 
top contributors to the open source Chromium project, Samsung are helping to advance the web platform, improving
the experience of using the web for people across the globe.

## About the team
The Developer Advocacy team launched last year to help support 3rd party developers who are building web applications on top of Samsung’s browser. We create demonstrations, present at conferences and generally help to develop and promote Web APIs. In particular, we are keen supporters of Progressive Web Apps and WebVR.

With the team’s responsibilities growing, we are looking to bring on a team member who can help us to communicate with developers as well as end users.

The team is based at Samsung Research UK in Staines-upon-Thames. We collaborate closely with colleagues internationally, particularly in South Korea and the US.

## What you could expect
The kind of opportunities this role would offer include:

* Creating materials to inform end users and developers about our browser and its latest features, for example web pages and videos.
* Working with press and media contacts, external bloggers and podcasters.
* Developing cross-promotional initiatives with key partners.
* Participating on social media and helping to grow our online communities.
* Arranging, attending and speaking at technology events, to help raise awareness.
* Consolidating public feedback about our browser, in order to recommend new features and improvements.
* Writing technical documentation, blog posts, and performing user research.
* Contributing to the development of open web standards.

## Necessary Skills / Attributes
This is a position for someone who loves the web and is keen to advocate it. As a bridge between engineering and the wider world, the role would suit someone with experience of communicating with developers and contributing to technical documentation. Alternatively, experience of consumer marketing in a technical product development environment would also be advantageous.

We are looking for someone with a solid understanding of web technologies and how the web is advancing. Candidates with web development experience are highly preferred.
